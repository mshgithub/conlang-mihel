# The _mihel_ ConLang
_mihel_ is a constructed language that I designed for fun over the 2025 Holiday Season. Enjoy! 

_NOTE: I made liberal use of ChatGPT to design _mihel_ and to learn what I needed to know about linguistics to do so._

### Sample Writings

  - _1 short story_
  - _1 emotional conversation_
  - _1 technical explanation_

## Design Principles
I designed the _mihel_ language to be simple to learn and expressive. 

1. Easy to learn
  - Minimal irregularity
  - Predictable grammar
  - Small phoneme inventory
2. Expressive
  - Able to convey nuance without long sentences
  - Supports abstraction, emotion, and metaphor
3. Explicit tense
  - Clear distinction between past, present, future
  - No ambiguity unless intentionally allowed
4. Gender-neutral
  - No grammatical gender
  - No gender marking on nouns, pronouns, or adjectives
5. Compact core lexicon
  - ~2,500–5,000 core concepts
  - Heavy use of derivation and compounding

### Typological Profile
_mihel_ uses an analytic–agglutinative hybrid typological profile.

Analytic (like English or Mandarin):
- Little or no inflection
- Word order + particles carry meaning

Agglutinative (like Turkish or Esperanto):
- Small, regular affixes
- One meaning per affix

This hybrid gives:
- Learnability
- Expressive precision
- Compact encoding

## Details

### Alphabet
_mihel_ uses an alphabet consisting of 14 consonants and 5 vowels.

| Letter |	Type	| Pronunciation |	Pronunciation Guide |
|---|---|---|---|
| b	| consonant | /b/	| as in "ba" |
| d	| consonant	| /d/	| as in "da" |
| p	| consonant	| /p/	| as in "pa" |
| g | consonant	| /g/	| as in "ga" |
| t | consonant	| /t/	| as in "ta" |
| k	| consonant |	/k/	| as in "ka" |
| m | consonant	| /m/	| as in "ma" |
| n	| consonant	| /n/	| as in "na" |
| l	| consonant	 | /l/ | as in "la" |
| r	| consonant	 | /r/ | as in "ra" (This is a tap r. It can be trilled for emphasis.) |
| w	| consonant	| /w/	 | as in "wa" |

### Morphology

#### Nouns
Nouns always end in consonants. For example, these are all acceptable forms for nouns: CVC, CVCVC, CVCVCVC, etc.

#### Verbs
Verbs always end in vowels. For example, these are all acceptable forms for verbs: CV, CVCV, CVCVCV, etc. Verbs are not conjugated. Instead, the speaker can follow the verb by either "pa" for something that occurred in the past, "na" for something that is happening now, or "fa" for something that will happen in the future; however, ...

#### Negation
Anything can be negated, reversed, or inverted by prefixing it with "a". For example, if "go" is the verb for movement, "ago" is the verb for remaining stationary. Similarly, if "fe" is the noun for a woman, "afe" is the noun for a man.

#### Word Creation
New words are created by compounding words that represent the relevant concepts. All the other rules must be followed. For example, if "go" is the word for movement and "far" is the word for away, then "gofara" can be used for the verb form of "leave" and "gofar" can be used for the noun form.

| Past | pa + verb |  |
| Present | na + verb |  |
| Future | fa + verb |  |
| Uncertain Past | apa + verb |  |
| Uncertain Present | ana + verb |  |
| Uncertain Future | afa + verb |  |
