# The _mihel_ ConLang
_mihel_ is a constructed language that I designed for fun over the 2025 Holiday Season. Enjoy! 

_NOTE: I made liberal use of ChatGPT to design _mihel_ and to learn what I needed to know about linguistics to do so._

## Design Principles
I designed the _mihel_ language to be simple to learn and expressive. 

1. Easy to learn
  - Minimal irregularity
  - Predictable grammar
  - Small phoneme inventory
2. Expressive
  - Able to convey nuance without long sentences
  - Supports abstraction, emotion, and metaphor
3. Explicit tense
  - Clear distinction between past, present, future
  - No ambiguity unless intentionally allowed
4. Gender-neutral
  - No grammatical gender
  - No gender marking on nouns, pronouns, or adjectives
5. Compact core lexicon
  - ~2,500–5,000 core concepts
  - Heavy use of derivation and compounding

### Typological Profile
_mihel_ uses an analytic–agglutinative hybrid typological profile.

Analytic (like English or Mandarin):
- Little or no inflection
- Word order + particles carry meaning

Agglutinative (like Turkish or Esperanto):
- Small, regular affixes
- One meaning per affix

This hybrid gives:
- Learnability
- Expressive precision
- Compact encoding
