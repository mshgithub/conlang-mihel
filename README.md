# The _mihel_ ConLang
_mihel_ is a constructed language that I designed for fun over the 2025 Holiday Season. Enjoy! 

_NOTE: I made liberal use of ChatGPT to design _mihel_ and to learn what I needed to know about linguistics to do so._

### Sample Writings
_Coming Soon! Will include:_
  - _10 basic sentences_
  - _1 short story_
  - _1 emotional conversation_
  - _1 technical explanation_

## Design Principles
I designed the _mihel_ language to be simple to learn and expressive. 

1. Easy to learn
  - Minimal irregularity
  - Predictable grammar
  - Small phoneme inventory
2. Expressive
  - Able to convey nuance without long sentences
  - Supports abstraction, emotion, and metaphor
3. Explicit tense
  - Clear distinction between past, present, future
  - No ambiguity unless intentionally allowed
4. Gender-neutral
  - No grammatical gender
  - No gender marking on nouns, pronouns, or adjectives
5. Compact core lexicon
  - ~2,500–5,000 core concepts
  - Heavy use of derivation and compounding

### Typological Profile
_mihel_ uses an analytic–agglutinative hybrid typological profile.

Analytic (like English or Mandarin):
- Little or no inflection
- Word order + particles carry meaning

Agglutinative (like Turkish or Esperanto):
- Small, regular affixes
- One meaning per affix

This hybrid gives:
- Learnability
- Expressive precision
- Compact encoding

## Details

### Alphabet
_mihel_ uses an alphabet consisting of 14 consonants and 5 vowels.

| Letter |	Type	| Pronunciation |	Pronunciation Guide |
|---|---|---|---|
| b	| consonant | /b/	| as in "ba" |
| d	| consonant	| /d/	| as in "da" |
| p	| consonant	| /p/	| as in "pa" |
| g | consonant	| /g/	| as in "ga" |
| t | consonant	| /t/	| as in "ta" |
| k	| consonant |	/k/	| as in "ka" |
| m | consonant	| /m/	| as in "ma" |
| n	| consonant	| /n/	| as in "na" |
| l	| consonant	 | /l/ | as in "la" |
| r	| consonant	 | /r/ | as in "ra" (This is a tap r. It can be trilled for emphasis.) |
| w	| consonant	| /w/	 | as in "wa" |
| y	| consonant	 | /j/	| as in "ya" |
| h |	consonant	| /h/	| as in "ha" |
| f	| consonant | /f/ | as in "fa" |
| a | vowel | /a/	| as in "ah" |

| o | vowel | /o/ | as in "oh" |

### Morphology

#### Word Creation
New words are created by compounding words that represent the relevant concepts. All the other rules must be followed. For example, if "go" is the word for movement and "far" is the word for away, then "gofara" can be used for the verb form of "leave" and "gofar" can be used for the noun form.

#### Negation
Anything can be negated, reversed, or inverted by prefixing it with "a". For example, if "go" is the verb for movement, "ago" is the verb for remaining stationary. Similarly, if "fe" is the noun for a woman, "afe" is the noun for a man.

#### Nouns
Nouns always end in consonants. For example, these are all acceptable forms for nouns: CVC, CVCVC, CVCVCVC, etc.

#### Verbs
Verbs always end in vowels. For example, these are all acceptable forms for verbs: CV, CVCV, CVCVCV, etc. 

##### Root Verb Morphemes

| | a | e | i | o | u |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| b	| ba () | be (exist or be located at) | bi () | bo () | bu () |
| d	| da () | de () | di () | do () | du () |
| p	| pa () | pe () | pi () | po () | pu () |
| g | ga () | ge () | gi () | go (move or change) | gu () |
| t | ta () | te () | ti () | to () | tu () |
| k	| ka (believe) | ke (know) | ki () | ko () | ku () |
| m | ma () | me () | mi () | mo () | mu () |
| n	| na () | ne () | ni () | no () | nu () |
| l	| la () | le () | li () | lo () | lu () |
| r	| ra () | re () | ri () | ro () | ru () |
| w	| wa () | we () | wi () | wo () | wu () |
| y	| ya () | ye () | yi () | yo () | yu () |
| h | ha () | he () | hi () | ho () | hu () |
| f	| fa () | fe () | fi () | fo () | fu () |

##### Verb Creation
Verbs are created by combining root verbs to more closely express the action. For example, _go_ means _to move or change_ and _be_ means _to exist or be located at_, so _gobe_ means _to travel_. Similarly, since _ka_ means _to believe_, _goka_ means _to change one's mind_.

##### Verb Modifiers

###### Tense
Verbs are not conjugated. Instead, the speaker can follow the verb by one of the words below to indicate the tense of the action; however, use of the tense modifiers is only required when the tense cannot be infered from context.

| Tense | Word | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Past | et | go et (moved) |
| Present | it | go it (move) |
| Future | ot | go ot (will move) |
| Uncertain Past | alet | go alet (\[may/should/ought to\] have moved) |
| Uncertain Present | alit | go alit (\[may/should/ought to\] move) |
| Uncertain Future | alot | go alot (\[may/should/ought to\] move in the future) |

####### Sample Sentences Illustrating The Tense Modifiers
The woman moved: fem go et.

The woman moves: fem go it.

The woman will move: fem go ot. 

If the man moved, the woman may have moved: afem go alet fem go alet. This can also be simplified to: afem fem ala go alet. This form uses _ala_, which indicates that if the first subject does something the following subject does as well.

When the man moved, the woman should have moved: afem go et fem go alet.

When the man moved, the woman moved: afem go et fem go et. Or: afem ala fem go et.

If the man moves, the woman may (or should) move: afem go alit fem go alit. Or: afem ala fem go alit.

If the man moves, the woman will move: afem go alit fem go ot.

When the man moves, the woman may (or should) move: afem go it fem go alit.

When the man moves, the woman will move: afem go it fem go ot.

If the man moves in the future, the woman may move: afem go alot fem go alot. Or: afem ala fem go alot.

When the man moves in the future, the moman may (or should) move: afem go ot fem go alot.
